# About me:
*My name's **Grey** for short.I'm 16 years old. I'd crave to be a software Engineer some day.*
### Hobbies
*I do swimming as a sport and I watch anime in my spare time.*
### Projects
*If you have improvements that you could add to my projects, you can make a fork and modify it later, make a pull request and if I see that it does not harm the structure of the project, I will accept it :).*
